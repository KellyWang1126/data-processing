At the two FA-15 sites, water levels from pressure transducers complement the firn temperatures records. Each string of temperature sensors was installed in a borehole drilled through the aquifer, hanging in the air when above the water table and in the water when below the water table. For the two FA-15 sites, a pressure transducer was installed in the same hole, located about 1 meter below the water table and vented at the surface. Each borehole was then backfilled with unconsolidated surface snow.</para><para>For FA-13 (66.1812° N, 39.0435° W, 1563 m), firn temperatures were collected between April 09, 2013 and September 13, 2015. For FA-15-1 (66.3622° N, 39.3119° W, 1664 m), firn temperatures and water levels were collected between April 17, 2015 and February 22, 2017. For FA-15-2 (66.3548° N, 39.1788° W, 1543 m), firn temperatures and water levels were collected between August 9, 2015 and February 2, 2017.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>firn aquifer</keyword><keyword>Greenland Ice sheet</keyword><keyword>percolation zone</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>This work is dedicated to the public domain under the Creative Commons Universal 1.0 Public Domain Dedication.

The pressure transducer was located about 2 meter below the water table to remain in range while anticipating vertical water-level fluctuations on the order of a few meters.
